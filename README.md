## Mission

This project aims to turn Robot Framework projects into event-driven services using popular message brokers like RabbitMQ, Kafka or MQTT.

## Installation

You can install reactive-robot into projects using pip;

```
pip install reactive-robot
```

## Usage

Create a definition file called `reactive-robot.yml` then paste following configuration;

```yaml

service_name: Example Robot Service
service_version: 1.0.0

connector:
  driver: reactive_robot.connectors.mqtt.MQTTConnector
  connection_url: mqtt://localhost:1883

bindings:
  - name: Example Task
    topic: robot-queue
    robot:
      file: your-robots/examples.robot
      args: null
```

You're all set!
Now all you have to do is start the service;

```
python -m reactive_robot serve
```

You should see the following output;

```
$ python -m reactive_robot serve
2021-11-27 18:22:58,517 - [INFO] - reactive_robot.serve::serve::40 - Using Robot Framework v4.1.2 (Python 3.10.0 on darwin)
2021-11-27 18:22:58,518 - [INFO] - reactive_robot.serve::serve::47 - Event loop started. Waiting for events.
```

Finally publish a message to see your robots are running.

```
python tests/mqtt/publish.py localhost 1883
```
## Examples

In this section you can find example implementations with different message brokers;
You need **`docker`** and **`docker-compose`** in order to execute example projects.

### Robot Service with Kafka Broker

Navigate to the `examples/kafka`
```
cd examples/kafka
```

Then start containers with below; 

```
docker-compose up
```

Finally, trigger an event in basic topic to see your robots are running;

```
docker-compose exec robot-service python /opt/service/publish.py basic 
```


### Robot Service with MQTT Broker

Navigate to the `examples/mqtt`
```
cd examples/mqtt
```

Then start containers with below; 

```
docker-compose up
```

Finally, trigger an event to see your robots are running;

```
docker-compose exec mqtt-broker /opt/hivemq-4.7.2/tools/mqtt-cli/bin/mqtt pub --topic basic --message TEST_VAR:321
```

## Recipes

In the [examples/](examples) directory you can find example projects which implements all recipes below;

### Dockerize your service

Here you can find an example Dockerfile to convert your Robot Framework projects into dockerized event-driven service 

```dockerfile
FROM robotframework/rfdocker

WORKDIR /opt/service

COPY . /opt/service
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  # Your project dependencies.

# reactive-robot setup
COPY reactive-robot.yml .
RUN pip install reactive-robot

CMD ["python", "-m", "reactive-robot", "serve"]
```

Then, we can build the image with following;

```
docker build -t robot-service:1.0.0 .
```

Finally, run your service;

```
docker run -it robot-service:1.0.0
```
