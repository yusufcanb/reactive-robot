```yaml

service_name: Example Robot Service
service_version: 1.0.0

connector:
  driver: reactive_robot.connectors.rabbitmq.RabbitMQConnector
  connection_url: amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672

bindings:
  - name: Example Task
    topic: robot-queue
    robot:
      file: your-robots/example.robot
      args: null
```

You're all set!
Now all you have to do is start the service;

```
python -m reactive_robot serve
```

You should see the following output;

```
$ python -m reactive_robot serve
